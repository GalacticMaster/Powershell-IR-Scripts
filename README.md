I've been using variations of this script for going on 3 years now and its always served me very well.  The inspiration comes from 
Corey Harrell who had a similar Perl script.

Since I didn't know Perl and it didn't really suit our environment, I modified his to work in Powershell and now we deploy it via
Carbon Black but it can still be used as a stand alone.

Credit for different sections of code are documented in the script.

Lines 30, 77, and 83 need to be adjusted for your environment
